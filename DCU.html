                                    <h3>What I achieved</h3>
									<p>During my time at Dublin City University (DCU), I have achieved high marks when it comes to my academics, however, academics
										wasn't my sole focus. While in college I spent a lot of times with societies, as well as academic competitions. When it came to societies
										I had a major role in the Raising and Giving Society (RAG) where I on the events team for two years, during these two years I managed multiple 
										club nights, trainings, community events, along with the largest event, RAG Rumble. This was an event I pushed to bring back after COVID, and 
										was very successful (if I do say so myself), having raised over €20,000 for charity. Over my two years looking after events we raised over
										 €50,000 for multiple charities and social organisations
									</p>
									<p>
										I also had the opportunity to compete abroad, winning a scholarship to attend the BIP Entrepreneurship Bootcamp in Berlin, 
										placing first and presenting my teams idea. We worked with 2Zero and created a reward scheme for tourists to walk around the
										city of Berlin rather than taking private or public transport. The innitative was to reduce the carbon footprint and make Berlin
										a more green and inviting city.
									</p>
									<p>
										Building on this I was selected among three other business school students to participate at the SG-Family Entreprise Case Study competition
										(the World Cup of Family Business Competitions) in Burlington, Vermont. During this we faced multiple teams across the glboal and finished on 
										the most points possible getting 16 points topping our group each day (4 points ahead of any team in the undergraduate league). 
										Unfortunately our luck ran out in the final, but for our first case competition we thought it was an unbelievable achievement.
